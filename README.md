# radical-ways overview:
This program is intended for car drivers and ordinary people, who need to get to a certain point through certain places. 
As an ordinary user, this program gives you the opportunity to move comfortably and get to the desired point with the necessary stops. You set the starting point and the destination, and if you need, you can also set  the places you want to visit during the trip. Then our program lays the shortest path between the points and publishes your trip. You can also view your route on the map. After publication, your trip becomes available to driver who can accept it. After accepting the trip, the user will be sent the data of the driver and his car.
As a driver, you will have access to a panel with user orders that you can view on the map. Among the available orders, you can choose the most convenient for you and accept it. If suddenly something happens and you cannot make the trip after accepting the order, you can also reject it.
